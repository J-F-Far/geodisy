The platform-independent binary is a GeoServer web application bundled inside Jetty, a lightweight and portable application server. It has the advantages of working very similarly across all operating systems and is very simple to set up.
Installation

1 	Make sure you have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system. GeoServer requires a Java 8 environment. The Oracle JRE is preferred, but OpenJDK has been known to work adequately. You can download JRE 8 from Oracle.

    Note: Java 9 is not currently supported.

2	Select the version of GeoServer that you wish to download. If youâ€™re not sure, select Stable.

3   Select Platform Independent Binary on the download page.

4   Download the archive and unpack to the directory where you would like the program to be located.

    Note: A suggested location would be /usr/share/geoserver.

5   Add an environment variable to save the location of GeoServer by typing the following command:

        echo "export GEOSERVER_HOME=/usr/share/geoserver" >> ~/.profile
        . ~/.profile

 
6   Make yourself the owner of the geoserver folder. Type the following command in the terminal window, replacing USER_NAME with your own username :

        sudo chown -R USER_NAME /usr/share/geoserver/

7   Start GeoServer by changing into the directory geoserver/bin and executing the startup.sh script:

        cd geoserver/bin
        sh startup.sh

8   In a web browser, navigate to http://{servername}:8080/geoserver.

If you see the GeoServer logo, then GeoServer is successfully installed.
